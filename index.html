          Adventure Time!

          There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” An adventure is something challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to try new things. The definition of adventure varies from person to person. It can best be described as, “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also be dangerous or in favour.”
          <br><br>
          While the definition of adventure can vary from person to person, in broader context “risk taken when its outcome is unknown” can be termed as adventure. It is something that challenges you, it is something that lets you escape from your ordinary lives & thus it is something that changes you. It can make you feel more live & refreshed. Adventures can be sought in numerous ways such as mountaineering, river rafting, trekking, skydiving, scuba diving, etc. Even exploring new people & cities can be considered as an adventure.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
          It's not simple to take your bike wherever you want. You just can't ride it anywhere and everywhere. Mountain biking is a kind of adventure sport which can be enjoyed far off the roads, often of rugged hills and terrains. 
          <br><br>
          Mountain biking is an adventure sport in which you go cycling across the unforgiving roads and alleys in tough mountain terrains. It is an off-road bicycling that can be pulled off only on specially designed bicycles and requires a lot of practice and stamina. For adventurers, it is a test of their nerve, precision, and optimum fitness.

          If there is one thing that has been the core of human fancy since ages, it surely is flying. After tasting the heights in the aircraft developed by Wright brothers, many wished to take it to the next level and feel something closer to a bird's flight!

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          If the last two years of the pandemic have taught us anything, it's that nature and being outdoors is so important for our wellbeing. After being locked inside for such a long time, surfing is the perfect way to completely immerse yourself in nature again!
          <br><br>
          After having had the same routines for a very long time, new impulses have definitely been lacking in many people's life. To learn something new and get out of your comfort zone is very healthy for you - it builds resilience and gives you a confidence boost. Going on a surf adventure is the perfect post- pandemic trip because you get to experience something totally different and use both your body and mind to learn something new.
